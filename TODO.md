# Starlark MCP Server - TODO List
*Feature requests from Claude after testing the server*

## Priority Features Requested by Claude

### 1. **Safe Standard Library Subset**
**Claude's Request:** Add basic mathematical functions commonly needed for computational work.

**Suggested additions:**
- `math.sqrt()`, `math.sin()`, `math.cos()`
- `math.pi`, `math.e` constants
- Enhanced statistical functions

**Claude's Rationale:** "Would reduce need for custom mathematical implementations like my `sqrt_approx()` function."
